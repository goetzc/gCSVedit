Developer documentation for gCSVedit
====================================

gCSVedit follows the same guidelines and code conventions as GtkSourceView:

    https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtksourceview/blob/master/HACKING

gCSVedit uses the GLib/GTK development platform, with GtkSourceView for showing
the CSV content:

    http://www.gtk.org/
    https://people.gnome.org/~swilmet/gtk-brochure.pdf
    https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GtkSourceView

You can read an introduction about GLib/GTK in the following document, which
also describes the reasons why the C language is a good choice when developing
a GTK application:

    https://people.gnome.org/~swilmet/glib-gtk-book/

For the build system, the Autotools (Autoconf, Automake and Libtool) are used.

It is recommended to use Jhbuild to develop gCSVedit:
