gCSVedit
========

gCSVedit is under development. The goal is to have a simple CSV editor that
runs on GNU/Linux and Windows (maybe Mac OS X too).

The editor aligns the columns by adding “virtual” spaces. When saving the file,
the added spaces are not saved.

It is planned to support any kind of delimiter-separated values (DSV) files,
not just comma-separated values (CSV) files. The delimiter will be
auto-detected, but if the guess is wrong, it'll be possible to provide the
delimiter. The application is called gCSVedit, because “CSV” is commonly used
to also refer to TSV (tab-separated values) or DSV in general.
