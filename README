gCSVedit
========

This is version 0.0.1 of gCSVedit.

gCSVedit is under development. The goal is to have a simple CSV editor that
runs on GNU/Linux and Windows (maybe Mac OS X too).

The editor aligns the columns by adding “virtual” spaces. When saving the file,
the added spaces are not saved.

Any kind of delimiter-separated values (DSV) files are supported, not just
comma-separated values (CSV) files. The application is called gCSVedit, because
“CSV” is commonly used to also refer to TSV (tab-separated values) or DSV in
general.

gCSVedit is a free/libre software (GPLv3+ license) and is hosted on GitHub:

Dependencies
------------

- GTK+
- GtkSourceView

Installation
------------

Simple install procedure:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  [ Become root if necessary ]
  $ make install

See the file 'INSTALL' for more detailed information.

From the Git repository, the 'configure' script and the 'INSTALL' file are not
yet generated, so you need to run 'autogen.sh' instead, which takes the same
arguments as 'configure'.
